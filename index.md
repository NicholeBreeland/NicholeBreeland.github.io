Nichole Breeland is a PhD candidate in the School of Psychology, and a Project Lead on the Ontological Roots of Cooperative Action longitudinal study in [The Early Learning Lab](https://www.earlylearning.ac.nz) at The University of Auckland. Nichole is particularly interested in social cognition and how internal processes affect behavioural outcomes across the lifespan. 

Nichole's research utilises diverse experimental methods (i.e., thematic analysis, eye-tracking, reaction time, and behavioural observation) and advanced statistical modelling (i.e., structural equation modelling, linear mixed models, and Bayesian inference) to investigate social-cognitive development across the first two years of life. Specifically, she examines how bio-ecological systems impact children's mental representations of shared-goals and ability to attain shared-goals (i.e., cooperate) with others. Her research also focuses on constructing a "cooperative phenotype" which identifies the relationships between children's social-cognitive abilities (e.g., intention understanding, attention capacity, and person perception) and their cooperative behaviours.
